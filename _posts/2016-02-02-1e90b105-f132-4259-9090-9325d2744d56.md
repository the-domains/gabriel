Having put out an Ep in 2015 Yelli Yelli is Emilie Hanak's new project. Emi has put out her previous albums under the name Milkymee.

Titled, Terre de mon Poeme, the album places the act of writing as a genuine statement of intent in the face of a wandering and stateless identity.

Born of an Algerian and Kabyle mother and a Czech father, Emilie Hanak carries her rich heritage proudly. Although a sense of rootlessness led her to live abroad for years, in Japan and in Sweden, before returning more recently to France, the country of her birth.

The theme of exile runs through her writing, music is the song of her call for home, a home she can believe in.

Looking for a collaborator for the project she had in mind, Emilie Hanak contacted songwriter snd producer Piers Faccini in 2014\. Seduced by the project, they quickly began developing her original idea of an album of covers into a record of original material with more often than not, Hanak providing lyrics and Faccini the music. The songs are music for our time, written mostly in Kabyle the language of Hanak's mother, the songs are interspersed with fragments of english and french.

Recorded in Faccini's studio in the countryside of the Cevennes in France, the 12 songs of Terre de mon Poeme are the songs of their encounter.

In 2016 with the storm of the migrant crisis in full force, Yelli Yelli's songs act as a gentle and persuasive cry for compassion snd dialogue, for in their way these are songs of exile, migrant songs.
